# Inventory management system

## Project introduction

The system is designed to help users manage their inventory precisely and efficiently,
there are 
- different warehouses under a user
- transaction history in each warehouse
- keep track of the key asset financials including **cost**, **stock**, **transactions**, etc. 
to help make decisions


This project is interesting for me because I can use it to manage some of my important belongings
in daily life as well. Later on, I can make it to different upgraded versions including *stock portfolio tracker*.

# Important Days

## Project introduction

The project is designed to help users:
- set **important days** in the future as reminder
- view details of that day's **arrangement**
- jog your precious memory and review the past important days

The project is designed for people who want to make *days matter*.
This project is so interesting for me because I enjoyed marking all important
days. I can see which important event is coming and how many days left.

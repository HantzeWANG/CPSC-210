# MovieFinder

## Project introduction

The MovieFinder is designed to help users:
- find interesting movies to watch and add them into your own **watchlist**
- view details of each movie or show and give your **personal rating**
- record the movies and shows you have watched and jog your precious memory


The project is designed for people who *love movies and shows* but have trouble to decide which one to watch next.
This project is interesting for me because I enjoyed watching movies and shows a lot, that would be  so fantastic if I
could have my own project to *record* and *find* different movies and shows.

# Inventory management system

## Project introduction

The system is designed to help users:
- manage their inventory more efficiently
- record each transaction in different warehouses
- view varies features including **cost**, **stock**, **transactions**, etc.


The project is designed for small enterprises to *manage their inventory* more efficiently.
User can view the transaction records and record every sell or purchase.
This project is interesting for me because I can use it to manage some of my important belongings
in daily life. Later on, I can make it to different versions including *stock portfolio tracker*.
